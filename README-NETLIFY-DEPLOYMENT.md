# My Bookmarks - Netlify Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy to Netlify

### Option 1: Manual Deployment (Easiest)

1. **Download the project files:**
   - Download your project as a ZIP from Replit
   - OR use the generated `my-bookmarks-netlify.tar.gz` file

2. **Go to Netlify:**
   - Visit [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign up or login
   - Click "Add new site" â†’ "Deploy manually"

3. **Upload your files:**
   - Drag and drop the entire project folder to Netlify
   - Netlify will detect it's a React app and configure automatically

4. **Site settings:**
   - Build command: `cd client-simple && npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `client-simple/dist`
   - Node version: 18

### Option 2: GitHub Integration (Recommended for updates)

1. **Push to GitHub first:**
   - Use the Git panel in Replit to push your code to GitHub
   - Or manually create a repository and upload files

2. **Connect to Netlify:**
   - In Netlify, click "Add new site" â†’ "Import from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select your repository

3. **Configure build settings:**
   - Base directory: `client-simple`
   - Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`

## Next Steps After Deployment

   - Verify all features work correctly

2. **Use with PWABuilder:**
   - Go to [pwabuilder.com](https://pwabuilder.com)
   - Enter your Netlify URL

3. **Customize your domain (optional):**

## Troubleshooting

- **Build fails:** The simplified version should build successfully with minimal dependencies
- **API not working:** The app uses in-memory storage, so data resets on each deployment
- **Share not working:** Make sure you're accessing via HTTPS (Netlify provides this automatically)
